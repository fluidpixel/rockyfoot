title: Flatfoot / Tibialis posterior dysfunction
tags: midfoot
presentation: |
  * Adult onset flat foot is usually related to degeneration of the tibialis posterior tendon. 
  * Patients have a fallen arch, pain along the inside of their foot and ultimately tilting of their heel outwards.
  * This deterioration is oftern gradual, however occasionally can be after an acute tear of the tendon.
  * The altered mechanics of the foot ultimately result in arthritis of surrounding joints. 
investigation-gp: |
  * Weight bearing foot X-ray (AP, oblique and lateral)
investigation-surgeon: |
  * MRI to look at tendon and joints
conservativeTreatment: |
  * Orthotics - arch support, UCBL or Arizona 
  * Physiotherapy - for strengthening and calf stretching
  * Injection of local anaesthetic and steroid into tendon sheath 
surgicalTreatment: |
  Calcaneal osteotomy, tibialis posterior debridement and FDL transfer 
    * Incision on outside of heel
    * Saw used to cut through calcaneus and shift it sideways. Fixed with 2 screws.
    * Incision along inside of foot 
    * Tibialis posterior tendon identified and debrided as necessary
    * FHL tendon cut distally and transferred into navicular bone to reinforce tibialis posterior tendon
    * Occasionally - sinus tarsi screw inserted or internal brace used to reinforce correction
risks: |
  1. Non-union of osteotomy
  1. Recurrent deformity 
  1. Arthritis
recovery: |
  * Keep foot elevated as much as possible, especially for initial 72 hours
  * Keep dressings dry and intact until post operative appointment.
  * Pain killers may be required for up to 2 weeks.
  * Removal of stitches: 10-14 days at first post operative appointment.
  * Touch weight bear in backslab for 2 weeks
  * Weight-bearing as tolerated in moonboot for 4 weeks
  * Recommencement of most activities: 12 weeks. Full recovery: 6-12 months.
  
  Every patientâ€™s recovery is individual and depends on the severity of the injury and the complexity of the surgery.
